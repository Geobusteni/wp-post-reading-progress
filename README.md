# wp-post-reading-progress

######Summary
A plguin that adds the reading time and the reading progress to single posts, pages or both of them.

At this moment, there is no support for custom post types. It will be added at a later time.

The information box shows a progress bar, which will complete once you scroll the content.

Going back up, it will empty the progress bar.

It also calculates and shows the total reading time for the page/post.

You can change the bar colors, add it to the top, bottom, left or right side of the screen .

The default location is static, before the content and then floated, once the scroll view passes the box location.

You can also choose if you want to show the total reading time and if you want to sho it on posts only, pages only, or on both of them.

Please use the issues for ideas about enhancing or for bugs.

Please keep in mind that the support is pretty limited at this point, since this plugin is done in my free time, so it might take a while until resolving an issue.
